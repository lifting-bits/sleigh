# Sleigh Library

[Sleigh](https://ghidra.re/courses/languages/html/sleigh.html) is a language used to describe the semantics of instruction sets of general-purpose microprocessors, with enough detail to facilitate the reverse engineering of software compiled for these architectures. It is part of the [Ghidra reverse engineering platform](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra) and underpins two of its major components: its disassembly and decompilation engines.

This repository provides a CMake-based build project for Sleigh so that it can be built and packaged as a standalone library and be reused in projects other than Ghidra.

## Build and Install the Sleigh Library

```sh
# Clone this repository (CMake project for sleigh)
git clone https://github.com/lifting-bits/sleigh.git
cd sleigh

# Configure CMake
cmake -B build -S .

# Build Sleigh
cmake --build build --parallel 8

# Install Sleigh
cmake --install build --prefix ./install
```

### Note on Ghidra source code

The Ghidra source code is not actually included in this git repo, and by default, CMake will automatically pull a stable version from the internet for you.

Please see [`src/README.md`](src/README.md) for more information on how to customize which Ghidra source code commit will be used/compiled, including specifying your own local copy of the Ghidra source.

## Packaging

The CMake configuration also supports building packages for Sleigh.

For example:

```sh
# Package Sleigh
cmake --build build --target package
```

## API Usage

An example program called `sleigh-lift` has been included to demonstrate how to use the Sleigh API. It takes a hexadecimal string of bytes and can disassemble it or lift it to p-code. The program can be invoked as follows, where the `action` argument must be either `disassemble` or `pcode`:

```sh
sleigh-lift [action] [sla_file] [bytes] [-a address] [-p root_sla_dir] [-s pspec_file]
```

For example, to disassemble the following byte string:

```sh
$ sleigh-lift disassemble x86-64.sla 4881ecc00f0000
0x00000000: SUB RSP,0xfc0
```

And to lift it to p-code:

```sh
$ sleigh-lift pcode x86-64.sla 4881ecc00f0000
(register,0x200,1) = INT_LESS (register,0x20,8) (const,0xfc0,8)
(register,0x20b,1) = INT_SBORROW (register,0x20,8) (const,0xfc0,8)
(register,0x20,8) = INT_SUB (register,0x20,8) (const,0xfc0,8)
(register,0x207,1) = INT_SLESS (register,0x20,8) (const,0x0,8)
(register,0x206,1) = INT_EQUAL (register,0x20,8) (const,0x0,8)
(unique,0x12c00,8) = INT_AND (register,0x20,8) (const,0xff,8)
(unique,0x12c80,1) = POPCOUNT (unique,0x12c00,8)
(unique,0x12d00,1) = INT_AND (unique,0x12c80,1) (const,0x1,1)
(register,0x202,1) = INT_EQUAL (unique,0x12d00,1) (const,0x0,1)
```

If you do not want to build `sleigh-lift`, you must set the CMake variable `sleigh_BUILD_EXTRATOOLS` option to `OFF` during CMake configuration.

## Helpers

This repository contains a helper not part of Sleigh/Ghidra, which you can find in the `support` directory. It has the following signature and can help the user find the location of a given spec file on the system:

```c++
std::optional<std::filesystem::path>
FindSpecFile(std::string_view file_name,
             const std::vector<std::filesystem::path> &search_paths =
                 gDefaultSearchPaths);
```

The `sleigh::FindSpecFile` function will search the paths provided by the user via the `search_paths` argument for a spec file with the name `file_name`. The default argument for `search_paths` is `sleigh::gDefaultSearchPaths` which contains the install/build directories generated during CMake configuration and a set of common installation locations.

If you do not want to build the helpers, you must set the CMake variable `sleigh_BUILD_SUPPORT` option to `OFF` during CMake configuration.

## Integration as a Dependency

An installation of Sleigh provides a CMake interface that you can use when building your project.

You can find an example of how to use the CMake package config file in the [find_package](tests/find_package/CMakeLists.txt) example.

We also provide a CMake helper function [`sleigh_compile`](cmake/modules/sleighCompile.cmake) to compile your `.slaspec` files using a sleigh compiler.

You can find a more complex CMake example with compiling Sleigh specifications in the [`example`](example/CMakeLists.txt) directory, which uses the upstream-provided sleigh example source code.

Lastly, you can locate the installed compiled sleigh files through the CMake variable `sleigh_INSTALL_SPECDIR`, which is an absolute path to the root directory for the compiled sleigh files---you should manually inspect this to know what to expect.

Referencing the [CMake config file](cmake/install-config.cmake.in) and [`specfiles` CMake file](sleighspecs/specfiles.cmake.in) is also suggested for learning more about the exposed CMake variables and modules.
